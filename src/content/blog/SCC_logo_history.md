### Unveiling the History: Decoding the NTHU SCC Logo

The logo of the Student Cluster Competition Team of National Tsing Hua University serves as a powerful emblem representing the institution's dedication to advancing computing technologies. The centerpiece of the design is the panda, an image that not only resonates with the university's identity but also signifies the strength and serenity within the realm of computational research. With the integration of GPGPU acceleration cards, the supercomputing capabilities at NTHU SCC have experienced remarkable enhancements, propelling research and development to new heights.

In the words of Hsiao Yi-Cheng, the creative journey behind this logo was nothing short of an odyssey through design and collaboration. "We started off with Procreate to sketch out the initial concepts. The line work had to be precise; it was the foundation upon which our entire design would be built. Once we were satisfied with the sketches, we moved the project into Affinity Designer, transitioning our ideas into a scalable vector format." Hsiao recalls the creative clashes that shaped the design's evolution, "Arguing with Mou Chan-Yu was part of the creative process. It pushed us toward excellence, and eventually, he took over the vector work while I directed our verbal symphony."

The development of the logo's identity involved intense debates, including one with Wang Tzu-Wen over the inclusion of the 'SCC' acronym. Hsiao narrates, "It was essential for the logo to embody the essence of our center, and the 'SCC' was a big part of that. But finding the right place for it in the design was a challenge. After several heated discussions, we found our middle ground."

Color played a pivotal role in conveying the center's character. "We experimented with a spectrum of colors. The transition from white to purple and back to white was a metaphor for our journeyâ€”full of trial and error, learning, and refinement," Hsiao explains. The final design, a blend of tradition and modernity, echoes NTHU SCC's ongoing quest for knowledge and its commitment to pushing the boundaries of supercomputing. Hsiao concludes, "Seeing the logo now, it's a reminder of our team's perseverance and unity. It's more than just a logo; it's a narrative of our collective ambition and relentless pursuit of innovation."
